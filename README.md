## About
<div align='justify'>
The Smart Braille Companion is a revolutionary device designed exclusively for visually-challenged individuals seeking independent Braille education. With its three distinct modes—Learning, Searching, and Testing—it offers an all-encompassing learning experience that caters to individual preferences and needs.
In Learning Mode, users explore Braille alphabets from A to Z through tactile impressions and accompanying voice output. 
The Searching Mode empowers users to voice-search for specific alphabets, receiving instant tactile braille representation and auditory feedback, while the Testing Mode challenges users with randomly generated Braille impressions, fostering interactive learning and real-time assessment. </div>

# Child Safety App

## Project Overview

<div align="justify"> The Child Safety App is a project developed as part of our Electrical Engineering course - Signals, Systems, and Random Processes. It addresses a significant concern among parents: ensuring the safety of their children while riding bicycles. Powered by Simulink for Android devices, this app provides real-time monitoring and proactive alerts, enhancing child safety and parental confidence. </div>

## Key Features

- **Boundary Monitoring:** The app tracks the child's movement and sends instant alerts to parents if the child crosses specified boundaries, ensuring they stay within safe areas.
  
- **Overspeed Detection:** Real-time speed monitoring helps prevent accidents by alerting parents if their child exceeds safe speeds while cycling.
  
- **Fall Detection:** Utilizing advanced sensors, the app detects falls and immediately notifies parents, allowing for swift response in case of emergencies.
  
- **SOS Messaging:** In the event of a fall, the app allows children to send SOS messages directly through the app, ensuring immediate assistance in emergencies.

## How It Works

<div align="justify"> The app utilizes Simulink to create an effective system for Android devices. It continuously monitors the child's location, speed, and movements. When predefined conditions (crossing boundaries, overspeeding, or falls) are met, instant alerts are sent to the parent's phone. The SOS messaging feature enables children to seek help specifically in case of falls, fostering a safer environment for young cyclists. </div>
