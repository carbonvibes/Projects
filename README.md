# About
<div align='justify'>
The Smart Braille Companion is a revolutionary device designed exclusively for visually-challenged individuals seeking independent Braille education. With its three distinct modes—Learning, Searching, and Testing—it offers an all-encompassing learning experience that caters to individual preferences and needs.
In Learning Mode, users explore Braille alphabets from A to Z through tactile impressions and accompanying voice output. 
The Searching Mode empowers users to voice-search for specific alphabets, receiving instant tactile braille representation and auditory feedback, while the Testing Mode challenges users with randomly generated Braille impressions, fostering interactive learning and real-time assessment. </div>
